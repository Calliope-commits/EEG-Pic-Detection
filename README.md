## Description : 
EEG epileptic spike detection is a crucial and challenging problem in both data science and neural science. The goal is to develop an algorithm to automatically detect whether an instance (such as EEG data series) captures an epileptic spike or not. 
Two common challenges are :
a). epileptic spike behaviors are minorities compared to normal behaviors
b). epileptic spike morphologies across different patients are quite different.

## Abstract : 

Abstract Epilepsy is a central neurological disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations and sometimes loss of awareness. Seizure detection is a routine process in epilepsy units requiring manual intervention of well-trained specialists. This process could be extensive, inefficient, and time-consuming, especially for long term recordings, making electroencephalography epileptic spike detection crucial the field of Neuroscience. In this paper we present a method to detect automatically if a series represents a series of epileptic spikes or a normal electroencephalography series. Our classification algorithm was applied on a dataset consisting of multivariate data series with a constant frequency, taken from two different experiments and preprocessed for desensitization. The method has an accuracy of 94.41% with a Gradient Boosted Tree model.
