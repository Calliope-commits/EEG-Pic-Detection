## Description : 
EEG epileptic spike detection is a crucial and challenging problem in both data science and neural science. The goal is to develop an algorithm to automatically detect whether an instance (such as EEG data series) captures an epileptic spike or not. 
Two common challenges are :
a). epileptic spike behaviors are minorities compared to normal behaviors
b). epileptic spike morphologies across different patients are quite different. 


You will find a notebook file as well as a PDF that details our process, analyses, and the conclusions drawn from our work
